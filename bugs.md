# Bugs and Issues - Status Update

## ‚úÖ FIXED - Critical Bugs

### 1. ~~Server Creation Bug in `src/server/server.ts:214`~~ ‚úÖ
**Status: FIXED**
- Fixed server creation to properly return HTTP server instance
- Server lifecycle is now properly managed by bootstrap function

## ‚úÖ FIXED - Major Issues

### 2. ~~Cache Connection Race Condition in `src/cache/service.ts`~~ ‚úÖ
**Status: FIXED**
- Added proper error handling in constructor with catch block
- Implemented Redis connection validation with ping test
- Added graceful degradation with Redis connection status checks
- Cache operations now handle Redis failures and fall back to memory cache

### 3. ~~Missing Error Handling in Metrics Endpoint~~ ‚úÖ
**Status: FIXED**  
- Added try-catch block around cache statistics retrieval
- Provides fallback data when Redis connection fails
- Metrics endpoint now remains available even when Redis is down

### 4. ~~Metrics Integration Gap in RPC Methods~~ ‚úÖ
**Status: FIXED**
- Added `recordRPCCall()` function calls in RPC method wrapper
- Success and failure metrics are now properly recorded
- Performance timing is captured for all RPC method calls

## ‚úÖ FIXED - TypeScript & Type Safety Issues

### 5. ~~Missing TypeScript Interfaces~~ ‚úÖ
**Status: FIXED**
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/sleeper.ts`
- Added proper type definitions for all Sleeper API responses:
  - User, League, Roster, Player, Draft, State objects
  - All method signatures now use proper types
  - API client methods have full type safety
- Removed all `any` types from API responses

### 6. ~~OpenRPC Schema Definitions Incomplete~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
- TypeScript types are now available for schema generation
- OpenRPC document structure is complete but schemas object still empty
- **Recommendation**: Generate OpenRPC schemas from TypeScript types (future enhancement)

## üß™ Testing Gaps

### 7. Missing Unit Tests for RPC Methods
**Priority: LOW**
- League, Player, Draft, and State RPC methods lack dedicated unit tests
- Only User RPC methods have comprehensive unit tests
- Need to add test files for:
  - `src/rpc/methods/league.test.ts`
  - `src/rpc/methods/player.test.ts`
  - `src/rpc/methods/draft.test.ts`
  - `src/rpc/methods/state.test.ts`

### 8. Cache Service Testing Minimal
**Priority: LOW**
- Cache service testing could be more comprehensive
- Missing edge case testing for cache failures and fallbacks

### 9. Middleware Testing Incomplete
**Priority: LOW**
- Middleware testing could be more comprehensive
- Missing tests for edge cases in rate limiting, error handling, etc.

## üìù Minor Issues

### 10. Unused Imports
**Priority: LOW**
- Some files may have unused imports (requires detailed analysis)
- Need to run eslint with unused imports rule enabled

### 11. Magic Numbers in Configuration
**Priority: LOW**
- Some magic numbers could be extracted to named constants
- Improve readability and maintainability

## üîç Areas Needing Verification

### 12. Type Safety Configuration
**Priority: LOW**
- Could benefit from stricter TypeScript configurations
- Consider enabling strict mode flags if not already enabled

### 13. Environment Variable Validation
**Priority: LOW**
- Verify all environment variables have proper defaults
- Ensure all required variables are documented
